# Hangman

- ** Description **

  The [Hangman](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hangman_(game)>) game is a simple game where one or more players try to guess a word, each turn suggesting a letter.

In this implementation, we will not have the drawing of the man being hanged. We will just have the word with the letters appearing as more and more letters are guessed correctly.

- ** Installation **
To launch the game, all that is needed is to run the following command in the terminal:

```bash
python main.py
```
or 
```bash
python3 main.py
```
